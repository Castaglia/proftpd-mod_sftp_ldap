We can create a fake HOOK, as provided by mod_ldap, for supplying the necessary
key data to mod_sftp_ldap.  Next, then, how to exercise those functions
for parsing/extracting keys from that data?

And how to do these tests, when there is no top-level configure script?  We
just need a Makefile (right)?  Maybe provide a configure script?
